	<h3 align=center>How to view my BMI from this chart?</h3>
		<p>First find your weight(kgs) on the top horizontal axis. Then go down following the BMI numbers all the way down 
until the height (ft/in or cm) on the left axis corresponds to your height. 
 Then you can know your weight status by color.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Blue   - Underweight </li>
		<li>Green  - Healthy Weight </li>
		<li>Yellow - Overweight </li>
		<li>Orange - Obese </li>
		<li>Red    - Extremely Obese </li>
		</ul>
	<h3 align=center>How much should I weigh for my height?</h3>
		<p>If you are not in the Healthy Weight status, you should know how weigh you must be. 
Simply go forward in your height row until the green color section cuts through. Any weight in green color on that row is suitable for your height. 
Then you can take a clear idea how to fit your weight according to your height.   </p>
