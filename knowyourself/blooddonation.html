<h3>How important blood donation?</h3>
<p>A continuous supply of blood is essential to meet the needs of patients. Blood is only available through the generosity of volunteer donors. 
It is estimated that 95% of the population will use blood or a blood component by the age of 75. Unfortunately, less than 5% of the eligible population actually donates.</p>

<h3 >Who need blood transfusions?</h3>
<p>A wide variety of patients receive blood transfusions. The various components of donated blood are 
used to treat different conditions. For example, red blood cells are transfused to patients who have 
lost blood due to trauma or surgery. Cancer patients 
need platelet transfusions to replace the healthy cells that are destroyed during chemotherapy 
and radiation. Burn victims often need plasma transfusions to treat them for shock.</p>

<h3 >Who can donate blood?</h3>
<p>People who are</p>
 
<ul>
<li>fit and healthy</li>
<li>weigh over 50kg</li>
<li>aged between 18 and 66
</ul>

<h3 >What should I do to prepare for donation?</h3>
<p>Eat a well-balanced meal, free of fatty or fried foods. A diet that regularly includes iron-rich 
foods will help promote red cell regeneration, increasing your chances of having an adequate hemoglobin level for blood donation.</p>


<h3 >How much blood is it safe for my body to lose?</h3>
<p>One pint. The average person has 10-12 pints, so the small loss is easily afforded. The fluid (plasma) is replaced within 24 hours. The red cells take about five weeks. You can donate again in eight weeks!</p>

<h3 >How will I feel after donation?<br> What activities can I do after my donation?</h3>

You can continue your normal routine, but avoid heavy lifting and strenuous exercise for 12 hours.</p>
