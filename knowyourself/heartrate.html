<h3 >How can I count my pulse rate?</h3>
<p>It’s easy to do. Place your index and middle finger on your wrist just below the thumb, or along either side of your neck, so you can feel your pulse. 
Use a watch to count the number of beats for 30 seconds and double it to get your beats per minute. Repeat a few times to ensure an accurate reading.
Now you can check whether you are in the healthy pulse rate according to the table.</p>

<h3>What can my resting heart rate (RHR) reflect my current — future health?</h3>
<p>One of the easiest, and maybe most effective, ways to gauge your health can be done in 30 seconds with two fingers. 
Measuring your resting heart rate (RHR) — the number of heart beats per minute while you’re at rest — is a real-time snapshot of 
how your heart muscle is functioning.</p>
<p>A lower RHR can mean a higher degree of physical fitness, which is associated with reduced rates of cardiac events like heart attacks.</p>
<p>A high RHR could be a sign of lower physical fitness and higher blood pressure, body weight, and levels of circulating blood fats and 
an increased risk of cardiac risk in some situations, even of premature death as the more beats your heart has to take eventually 
takes a toll on its overall function.</p>
<p>Some situations can make your RHR too low, which may cause occasional dizziness or fatigue. 
This may be the result of the electrical nodes of the heart aging, or not transmitting electrical signals correctly.</p>

<h3 >What factors can influence my heart rate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Activity level</li>
<li>Fitness level
<li>Air temperature</li>
<li>Body position (standing up or lying down, for example)</li>
<li>Emotions</li>
<li>Body size</li>
<li>Medications</li>
</ul>
